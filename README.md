UPDATE ON LIVE PREVIEW: Twitter suspended my API access for this project, which unfortunately breaks the functionality of the live website. I've appealed this suspension as I'm not aware of any rules this project violates, but in the meantime you can still see the code and screenshots for this project.

This is a concept site called Twitter Images that is, simply put, a "Google Images" but for Twitter. Search any term you want and a list of image results will appear. You can click on an image and it will take you to its respective tweet.

Utilized: JavaScript | React | Node.js | Express | Bootstrap | Twitter API | Cloudimage.io | DigitalOcean
